## Simon King: What is AI speech generation currently capable of?

		There are a bewildering number of papers being published about synthetic speech generation. Every new paper claims a major advance using yet another new model architecture. I will try to make sense of the landscape, concentrating on what the latest models are capable of.Â  These models are large, computationally expensive, and are trained on tens of thousands of hours of speech. Fortunately, many are also getting more capable: a single pre-trained model can do several tasks, such as text-to-speech and voice conversion. This might liberate us. Instead of tedious searches for the perfect model, we can instead concentrate on properly defining the problems we want to solve - What exactly is "conversational speech"? What would good cross-lingual prosody transfer sound like? Why do listeners sometimes prefer synthetic speech over natural speech? Does that mean we could generate synthetic speech that users trust more than natural speech?
